		<h5>Use of Information</h5>

		<p>We may combine your personally identifying information, and information about your preferences and activities, with those of all or a particular group of our users to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities.  For example, we may track the number of our users who view certain pages or use certain features or compile the user and company rankings conducted through our site in a particular geographic region. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users’ information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with efficient, smooth service.</p>

		</li>
		
		 
		<li><h5>Security</h5>  
		 
	<p>	TutorialTab takes precautions to protect our users’ information, including physical, electronic, and procedural measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to or use of personally identifiable user information.  Additionally, we restrict access to any transactional portions of our site to computers running web browsers that support Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol.  SSL-enabled browsers include Safari®, Internet Explorer®, Firefox®, Opera®, and Netscape Navigator® 3.0 or later.  This restriction better protects the confidentiality of credit card and personal information while it’s transmitted over the Internet. </p>
		 
	<p>	Please remember that you play a valuable part in security as well.  Your password that you select to access certain portions of our site should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently.  After you have finished using our site, you should log off and exit your browser so no unauthorized persons can use our site with your name and account information.  You should be confident that the security of your computer and network has not been compromised by “key loggers” or other security risks.  Remember that any information you voluntarily disclose in any news or message postings, discussion groups or chat rooms may be collected and used by others without your permission.  Furthermore, if you provide any information to parties who operate Web sites that are linked to or from our site, different rules may apply to their collection, use or disclosure of your personal information. We encourage you to review these sites’ policies before revealing any sensitive or personal information.  </p>
		 
<p>		Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.  We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.  </p>
		 
		<h5>Special Policy on Information Regarding Teens (persons 13 to 17 years of age)</h5> 
		 
		<p>Teens are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian before submitting any personally identifiable information.  A notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of all users who identify themselves as being between 13 and 17 years of age, which discloses the information provided by the teen and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of and participate in the teen’s on-line experience.  
		 </p>
		<h5>Arbitration</h5> 
		 
		<p>Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Policy shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The parties shall endeavor to select a mutually acceptable arbitrator knowledgeable about issues relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.  In the event the parties are unable to agree to such a selection, each party will select an arbitrator and the arbitrators in turn will select a third arbitrator. The arbitration will take place in Boston, Massachusetts.  Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.  </p>
		 
		<h5>Choice of Law; Jurisdiction; Forum</h5>  
		 
	<p>	This Privacy Policy will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of residence. Any claims, legal proceeding or litigation arising in connection with the Privacy Policy will be brought solely in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  You consent to the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts and U.S. courts sitting in Massachusetts.  </p>
		 
		<h5>Changes to Privacy Policy </h5> 
		 
	<p>	It may be necessary from time to time for us to modify this policy to reflect changes in the way we collect and use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, and industry standards. Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this policy at any time.  If we decide to revise our privacy policy, we will post our changes to this privacy policy, and to any other place on our site that we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  We do not undertake to e-mail our users of any changes that we make to this privacy policy. </p>
		 
	<p>	This policy was posted on April 19, 2010.  Data will be handled in accordance with the policy in effect at the time the data is collected.</p>
